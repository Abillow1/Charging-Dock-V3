# Charging Dock V3

Hello! This is the Github Repo for the Charging Dock V3, built for PicoVR. 
The case and PCB were designed by me (Abillow.)

This repo will contain all files for the charging dock.

> As of 3/27/2025 this is untested and still needs to be tested.
> Build instructions are yet to be made.

Anyone is free to modify this, however, you must apply the same CC lisense to the work and accredit me. I highly reccommend making a fork for it. Thank you.

> 3D Model of the Case for the Charging Dock V3. The green is the PCB, please note the USBC ports render incorrectly. The transparent yellow part is a LED cover, it is removable. The bottom grey part is the bottom plate. The top black part is the top interface. The case and PCB are designed so that you do not need to remove your straps.

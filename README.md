Hello! This is the Github Repo for the V3 charging dock for PicoVR. 
The case and PCB were designed by me (Abillow.)

This repo will contain all circut board files, all renders, all 3d designs, and more for the charging dock.

As of 3/27/2025 this is untested and still needs to be tested.

Anyone is free to modify this, however, you must apply the same CC lisense to the work and accredit me. I highly reccommend making a fork for it. Thank you.
